# üìä Amazon Data Analysis Project

## üìå Background
This project analyzes Amazon.com purchase behaviors of 5,027 users in the U.S. from 2018 to 2022. It includes purchase history, demographic data, and survey responses collected through an online survey. The data provides insights into consumer spending patterns, shopping preferences, and potential correlations with demographic factors.

## üéØ Motivation
With the growing e-commerce industry, understanding consumer behavior on Amazon is crucial for businesses, marketers, and researchers. This analysis aims to answer key questions such as:
- Which states have the highest Amazon spending per shopper?
- How do major life changes (e.g., job loss, moving) influence spending habits?
- What demographic groups are the most frequent Amazon shoppers?
- How does income level impact online shopping behavior?

- **California, Texas, and Florida** are the top three states with the highest total spending.
- The **West Coast and larger states** tend to have higher Amazon spending, while smaller states have lower total spending.
- This distribution suggests a correlation between population size and overall Amazon purchases.

</p>

- The most common life change reported was **moving to a new residence**, followed by **job loss**.
- Significant life events, such as **having a child or becoming pregnant**, also appear to influence shopping behavior.
